# Counter Number Project ðŸ”¢
This Java â˜• Project implements a simple number counter that takes two parameters from the user and prints the numbers in sequence. It includes error handling using a custom exception, ParametrosInvalidosException, to ensure valid input.

## Usage
1. Input Parameters:
- The user is prompted to enter the first parameter.
- The user is prompted to enter the second parameter.
  
2. Number Counting:
- The program validates the parameters and throws a `ParametrosInvalidosException` if the second parameter is not greater than the first.
- If the parameters are valid, the program counts and prints the numbers between the two parameters.

## Input using Scanner
The program utilizes the `Scanner` class to accept user input. Users need to follow these steps:

1. Enter the first parameter when prompted.
2. Enter the second parameter when prompted.
